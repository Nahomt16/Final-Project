    <h4><b>Tewen</b></h4>
    <p>Tewen is a unique tourist business site that aims to spread awareness about social issues in various cities while offering traditional tourist experiences. Founded by Nahom Tewelde, a high school student from San Francisco, Tewen operates in six cities: Boston, Chicago, Hartford, New York City, Providence, and San Francisco.

      Unlike typical tourist sites run by adults, Tewen stands out by employing local teenagers as guides. These young guides are not only knowledgeable about the city's attractions but also well-versed in its social challenges. For instance, in San Francisco, they educate tourists about homelessness, which is a prevalent issue in the city. Visitors to Tewen's website can choose tours that focus on understanding and learning about these urban challenges, in addition to enjoying the usual tourist attractions like driving across the Golden Gate Bridge or visiting Fisherman's Wharf.
      
      The core mission of Tewen is to raise awareness about societal issues across different cities. By offering tours that highlight these challenges, Tewen encourages visitors to not only enjoy the sights but also gain a deeper understanding of the city's social landscape. This approach is intended to foster empathy, education, and potentially inspire action among tourists and locals alike.
      
      In summary, Tewen leverages tourism as a platform to educate and spread awareness about the complex social issues faced by cities such as homelessness, thereby engaging both visitors and local youth in meaningful dialogue and advocacy.</p>
